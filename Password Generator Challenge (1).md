## Core Requirements (35 minutes)

### 1. Basic Game Structure (10 minutes)
- Welcome message and game introduction
- Player name input
- Simple game loop with user commands
- Exit/quit functionality

**Essential Commands:**
- `look` - describe current location
- `go [direction]` - move between rooms
- `inventory` - show collected items
- `help` - show available commands
- `quit` - exit game

### 2. Room System (15 minutes)
Create at least **4 connected rooms** with:
- **Name** (e.g., "Forest Clearing", "Dark Cave")
- **Description** (what the player sees)
- **Exits** (available directions: north, south, east, west)
- **Items** (objects that can be picked up)

**Example Room:**
```
=== FOREST CLEARING ===
You stand in a peaceful forest clearing. Sunlight filters through 
the tall oak trees, and you hear birds chirping nearby. There's 
a rusty key glinting in the grass.

Exits: north, east
Items: rusty key
```

### 3. Item Collection (5 minutes)
- `take [item]` - pick up items from rooms
- Items disappear from room when taken
- Store items in player inventory
- Handle invalid item names gracefully

### 4. Simple Win Condition (5 minutes)
Create a basic goal:
- Collect 3 specific items, OR
- Reach a special "treasure room", OR
- Find a hidden exit

**Win Message Example:**
```
ðŸŽ‰ CONGRATULATIONS! ðŸŽ‰
You found the ancient treasure! You are now rich beyond your wildest dreams!
Thanks for playing!
```

## Bonus Features (10 minutes)

Choose **ONE** bonus feature if you finish early:

### Option A: Simple Combat
- Add a monster in one room
- Player needs a weapon to defeat it
- `fight` command with random outcomes

### Option B: Locked Doors
- Some exits require specific items (like a key)
- Display helpful messages when blocked
- `use [item]` command to unlock paths

### Option C: Multiple Endings
- Different outcomes based on choices or items collected
- Good ending, bad ending, secret ending
- Track player decisions

### Option D: Save/Load Game
- `save` command to write game state to file
- `load` command to restore previous game
- Simple text file format

## Technical Requirements

### Game Data Structure
Represent your game world as a simple dictionary:

```python
# Example room structure
rooms = {
    "forest": {
        "name": "Forest Clearing",
        "description": "A peaceful forest clearing with tall oak trees.",
        "exits": {"north": "cave", "east": "village"},
        "items": ["rusty key"]
    },
    "cave": {
        "name": "Dark Cave", 
        "description": "A dark, damp cave. You hear water dripping.",
        "exits": {"south": "forest"},
        "items": ["torch", "gold coin"]
    }
    # Add more rooms...
}
```

### Input Handling
- Convert input to lowercase for consistency
- Split commands into parts: `take rusty key` â†’ `["take", "rusty", "key"]`
- Handle invalid commands with helpful error messages

### Code Organization
- Separate functions for different game actions
- Keep the main game loop simple and clean
- Use meaningful variable names
